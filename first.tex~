	A paragraph is supposed to go here. Am I really going to type or bother to copy paste a whole paragraph from somewhere? Too indecisive for that. I do enjoy writing, or rather typing up random stuff like this so I guess I will go with this. This many words should be enough for our purposes. Which reminds me, what was our purpose again?
